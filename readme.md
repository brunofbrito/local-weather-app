# Local Weather App

A simple app that uses 2 APIs to get the user's latitude/longitude through the IP address, to then search for the city's current weather.

**APIs:**
- <a href="http://ipinfo.io/" target="_blanl">ipinfo.io
- <a href="http://openweathermap.org" target="_blank">Open Weather Map</a>

This was a great exercise to train some **JavaScript/jQuery**, as well as **Flexbox** and **SASS**. I also used **Grunt** for the first time!
